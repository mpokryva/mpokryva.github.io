  <ul>
    <li>I'm a pretty decent home chef, a casual powerlifter, a hiker and runner, a guitar player and singer, and a lover of dark humor and stand-up comedy.</li>
    <li>I love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxTEoseZak">smoking meats</a> (I make a <i>mean</i> rack of <a href="https://jesspryles.com/recipe/smoked-bbq-beef-ribs/">beef ribs</a>) and cooking Mexican food. I can make tacos from scratch, including the tortillas.</li>
    <li>I own a Martin X Series Custom X1-000 guitar (which I play badly), and love to sing anything from Sinatra to The Beatles, to Billie Eilish.</li>
    <li>I'm working on cultivating a reading habit. Here's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/144395916-miki-pokryvailo?shelf=read">a list</a> of some books I've read. Please let me know if you have any book recommendations!</li>
    <li>I'm a big fan of The Office and Community, and some of my favorite stand up comedians are Nate Bargatze, Gary Gulman, and Sam Morril.</li>
    <li>I'm also natively trilingual in English, Russian, and Hebrew &#58;)</li>
