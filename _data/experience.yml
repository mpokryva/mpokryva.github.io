- company: Confluent, Mountain View, CA 
  position: Backend Software Engineer | Platform Services Team (API and CLI groups)
  duration: August 2019 &mdash; December 2020
  summary: |
    <ul>
    <li>Worked on the core API framework used across Confluent Cloud services. Use Go, Bash, OpenAPI, protobuf/gRPC, and Postgres.</li>
    <li> Won 1st place at a Confluent hackathon by speeding up deployments to our test environment by ~7x, and enabling developers to interactively debug their test environments (instead of adding print statements and redeploying). It's likely that this workflow has made debugging cloud services an order of magnitude faster for many engineers at Confluent.

    A message my co-worker got from someone about my hack.
    </figcaption>
    </li>
    <li>Developed a mechanism to measure integration test coverage for the Confluent CLI (command line interface), used
    extensively by both Confluent and its customers. On my own accord, I generalized the solution, <a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/bincover">open-sourced</a> it, and wrote
    an accompanying <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/measure-go-code-coverage-with-bincover/">blog post</a>.</li>
    <li>Won the People’s Choice Award at Confluent’s first hackathon for developing an interactive shell feature that
    improved the usability of the CLI. Afterwards, I was the engineering lead who shipped this feature to production.</li>
    <li>Proactively and single-handedly completed a refactoring of several thousand lines of code to improve the quality of Confluent's CLI. This significantly improved the flexibility and robustness of the codebase and fixed a number of critical bugs. I received an “engineering superstar” award for this after being at Confluent for only four months.</li>
    <li>Implemented a new type of API key and related API key-based authentication that’s widely used in Confluent’s UI and APIs.</li>
    <li>Added API backward compatibility checks to CI for Confluent’s private and public APIs.</li>
    <li>I signed my offer when Confluent had 400 people, joined 10 months later when it had 850, and did 3-4 interviews a week for months, less than a month after joining to help scale the startup to 1200+ people.</li>
