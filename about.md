Hi, I'm Miki! I'm a senior at Stony Brook University, double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Math. I'm interested in cloud computing, machine learning, robotics, computer vision, and more. When I'm not doing CS/math, I love playing badminton, working out, and taking long walks. I also sing and (try to) play guitar.

I'm also interested in startup/tech culture, and love reading books like Peter Thiel's Zero To One, The Everything Store, etc. Eventually, I'll add a list of the books I've read. If you have any book recommendations, please share them with me! 

I created this blog because I love to write, and every now and then I have an idea I'd like to write about, but no place to express it.

I would love to connect with you on Instagram/LinkedIn/GitHub/email!
